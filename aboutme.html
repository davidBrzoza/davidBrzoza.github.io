    <h2>David Brzoza is an avid video game player and aspiring game designer, hoping to become a part of the gaming industry to leave his mark on the world.

    David went to Essex High School for two years before being accepted into the Center for Technology at Essex's Computer Animation and Web Design program where he spent his junior year.  During his senior year he entered into the more exclusive second year of Computer Animation and Web Design where he is building his skills in game design.  David has also been working at the local Hannafords for about 5-6 months now.

    David hopes to work for a game studio and his greatest dream is to have his name in the credits of a video game he loves.  He hopes one day he can create a game that people will love and he is able to see his name scroll past.</h2>
